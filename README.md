# bank-management
This project implements a virtual bank called "THE BANK OF INDIA" using Python and MySQL. It enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer records stored in a MySQL database. Exception handling is extensively used to ensure user-friendliness.

This system is designed for bank staff to manage customer records securely. Only authorized users can access the program, where they can view and modify records. New users can create login credentials if they don't have them. Functionality includes displaying overall records, retrieving details of local customers or specific accounts, creating new customer records, updating existing records, deleting customer records, and managing customer loans. Python serves as the front end, while MySQL acts as the back end.
